"""`sara.live`: a plain NumPy function with sliders, rerun on every move and written to a layer.

    import sara
    doc, layer, pixels = sara.init()
    doc.import_image("img/balls.png")

    PARAMS = {"amount": (1.0, 0.0, 1.0), "mode": ["Multiply", "Screen"], "invert": False}
    TITLE = "Goal NumPy"

    def apply(img, amount, mode, invert):
        ...                               # img is float32 (h, w, 4) RGBA, the answer the same shape
        return out

    sara.live(apply, PARAMS, source="balls")

The function and its `PARAMS` are the ones the Krita plugin template takes unchanged, and
`sara_params.py` reads the dict the way the template does: a bool is a checkbox, a tuple a slider, a
`"#rrggbb[aa]"` string a colour picker (with an alpha slider beside it for the eight-digit form), a list of
str a drop-down and an n by n list of lists a grid of number fields. `apply(img, **values)` runs once with the
defaults and then on every move, debounced so a drag runs it at most once a frame, and what it answers is
written to the layer called *target*, which is `TITLE` of the notebook when none is given, a layer of that name
being reused, so running the cell again leaves one. The source is read once when the cell runs, and each call
gets a copy of it, so a function that edits `img` in place never compounds across moves.

A drag is one undo step. Each write of a move records none, and Sara keeps what it overwrote,
and when the widgets have rested for `LET_GO_S` the last picture is written once more with history on, which
Sara records with every write of the drag as the one step. The cell's own first run records its step at once.

A module of its own beside `sara_notebook.py`, whose debounce and connection it shares, so `sara.py` stays
free of `ipywidgets` and `sara.live` imports this at its first call.
