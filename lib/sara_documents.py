"""The paintings open in Sara beside the one a notebook is working on, and which is in front.

    import sara
    doc, layer, a = sara.init()        # a new document, in front of whatever else is open
    doc.documents()                    # every open painting, in tab order, the front one marked
    doc.front("study.sad")             # brings that one forward, the way a click on its tab does

`sara.py`'s `Document.documents` and `Document.front` are these two calls, kept
in a file of their own because `sara.py` is near the thousand lines a file is
allowed. They speak the door's `documents` and `front` steps, which
`ui/document_tabs/sa_document_tabs.gd` answers and
[DOOR-STEPS.md](../../docs/guides/DOOR-STEPS.md) lists.

Every other step acts on the document in front, `init()` included, so these two
are what a notebook reaches a second painting through: bring it forward, do the
work, bring the first back. Nothing outside the standard library but `sara`
itself, for its door and its error, the way `sara_array.py` imports it.
